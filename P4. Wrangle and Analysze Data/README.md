# Udacity Data Wrangling and Analyzing.

### Introduction
Real-world data rarely comes clean. Using Python and its libraries, you will gather data from a variety of sources and in a variety of formats, assess its quality and tidiness, then clean it. This is called data wrangling.

The dataset that will be wrangled (and analyzed and visualized) is the tweet archive of Twitter user @dog_rates, also known as WeRateDogs.
WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. These ratings almost always have a denominator of 10.
The numerators, though? Almost always greater than 10. 11/10, 12/10, 13/10, etc. Why? Because "they're good dogs Brent."
WeRateDogs has over 4 million followers and has received international media coverage.

WeRateDogs downloaded their Twitter archive and sent it to Udacity via email exclusively for you to use in this project. This archive contains basic tweet data (tweet ID, timestamp, text, etc.) for all 5000+ of their tweets as they stood on August 1, 2017. More on this soon.

#### Storing, analyzing, and visualizing your wrangled data
Reporting on:
1. Data wrangling efforts.
2. Data analyses and visualizations.
3. Gathering Data of the three pieces of data as described below.

#### Assessing Data for this Project
After gathering each of the above pieces of data, assess them visually and programmatically for quality and tidiness issues.
Detecting and documenting at quality issues and tidiness issues.
#### Cleaning Data for this Project
Cleaning each of the issues which documented while assessing.
