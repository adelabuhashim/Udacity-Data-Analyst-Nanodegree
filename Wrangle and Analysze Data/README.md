# Udacity Data Wrangling and Analyzing.

### Introduction
Real-world data rarely comes clean. Using Python and its libraries, you will gather data from a variety of sources and in a variety of formats, assess its quality and tidiness, then clean it. This is called data wrangling. You will document your wrangling efforts in a Jupyter Notebook, plus showcase them through analyses and visualizations using Python (and its libraries) and/or SQL.

The dataset that you will be wrangling (and analyzing and visualizing) is the tweet archive of Twitter user @dog_rates, also known as WeRateDogs. WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. These ratings almost always have a denominator of 10. The numerators, though? Almost always greater than 10. 11/10, 12/10, 13/10, etc. Why? Because "they're good dogs Brent." WeRateDogs has over 4 million followers and has received international media coverage.

WeRateDogs downloaded their Twitter archive and sent it to Udacity via email exclusively for you to use in this project. This archive contains basic tweet data (tweet ID, timestamp, text, etc.) for all 5000+ of their tweets as they stood on August 1, 2017. More on this soon.

### What software do you need?

You need to be able to work in a Jupyter Notebook on your computer. Please revisit our Jupyter Notebook and Anaconda tutorials earlier in the Nanodegree program for installation instructions.

The following packages (libraries) need to be installed. You can install these packages via conda or pip. Please revisit our Anaconda tutorial earlier in the Nanodegree program for package installation instructions.

* pandas
* NumPy
* requests
* tweepy
* json

You need to be able to create written documents that contain images and you need to be able to export these documents as PDF files. This task can be done in a Jupyter Notebook, but you might prefer to use a word processor like Google Docs, which is free, or Microsoft Word.
A text editor, like Sublime, which is free, will be useful but is not required.

### Project Details
Your tasks in this project are as follows:

#### Data wrangling, which consists of:
* Gathering data
* Assessing data
* Cleaning data

#### Storing, analyzing, and visualizing your wrangled data
Reporting on 1) your data wrangling efforts and 2) your data analyses and visualizations
Gathering Data for this Project
Gather each of the three pieces of data as described below in a Jupyter Notebook titled wrangle_act.ipynb:

#### Assessing Data for this Project
After gathering each of the above pieces of data, assess them visually and programmatically for quality and tidiness issues. Detect and document at least eight (8) quality issues and two (2) tidiness issues in your wrangle_act.ipynb Jupyter Notebook. To meet specifications, the issues that satisfy the Project Motivation (see the Key Points header on the previous page) must be assessed.

#### Cleaning Data for this Project
Clean each of the issues you documented while assessing. Perform this cleaning in wrangle_act.ipynb as well. The result should be a high quality and tidy master pandas DataFrame (or DataFrames, if appropriate). Again, the issues that satisfy the Project Motivation must be cleaned.

#### Storing, Analyzing, and Visualizing Data for this Project
Store the clean DataFrame(s) in a CSV file with the main one named twitter_archive_master.csv. If additional files exist because multiple tables are required for tidiness, name these files appropriately. Additionally, you may store the cleaned data in a SQLite database (which is to be submitted as well if you do).

Analyze and visualize your wrangled data in your wrangle_act.ipynb Jupyter Notebook. At least three (3) insights and one (1) visualization must be produced.

#### Reporting for this Project
Create a 300-600 word written report called wrangle_report.pdf or wrangle_report.html that briefly describes your wrangling efforts. This is to be framed as an internal document.
