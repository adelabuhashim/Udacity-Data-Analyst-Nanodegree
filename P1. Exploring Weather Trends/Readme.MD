## Summary

Analyzing local and global temperature data and comparing the temperature trends where I live to overall global temperature trends.


## Steps

- The goal is to create a visualization and prepare a write up describing the similarities and differences between global temperature trends and temperature trends in the closest big city to where you live(Cairo).
Extract the data from the database.
Export the temperature data for the world as well as for Cairo.


    SQL query to extract the city level data. Export to CSV.
    SQL query to extract the global data. Export to CSV.


- Open up the CSV
- Create a line chart that compares Cairo temperatures with the global temperatures.
Plotting moving average rather than the yearly averages in order to smooth out the lines, making trends more observable.
- Make observations
